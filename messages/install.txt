 Thank you for installing Logging Control
===========================================

You can now control the behavior of logging output.

Logging Control only works for plugins that already uses the
standard logging module. Using the standard logging module is
a best practice, but unfortunately not always used. If you want
to display logging output for a plug-in that does not use the
standard logging library, consider writing the author of the plug-in
and ask him/her to implement logging using the standard logging
library. Or, if you have the ability to do so, fork the plug-in
implement the desired logging behaviour, and send the author a
pull request.

To find and invoke the logging control commands, use ctrl+shift+p
(cmd+shift+p on OS X). Start typing "logging" and you should see a
list of logging control commands displayed.

You can configure Logging Control in it's settings:
    Preferences -> Package Settings -> Logging Control -> Settings - User
    Preferences -> Package Settings -> Logging Control -> Settings - Default

You can copy the default settings to the user settings file to get started.
